* **Yes, yes**, in this very first version (*114.0.5735.134*) **only by disabling the sandbox** - otherwise the browser will not start! **Yes**, it can be fixed - but it will take more time for a quality fix. **Yes**, perhaps hardware acceleration of **DirectX 11** after fixing the sandbox will also work perfrectly on the Windows 7.

## Intro  
Dirty corporations and Hindu-managers are trying to deprive the any users of all the benefits that were created by technically more advanced people than them. Windows 7 and Windows XP are the most successful and best technical creations of Microsoft ever.  
  
## How it's work?  
1) **Binary bithack (patch the assembly code):**  
* chrome.exe  
* *{ver.}*/chrome_elf.dll  
* *{ver.}*/chrome.dll  

2) **WinAPI LIFTING - Missing WINAPIs are deployed:**  
* API-MS-WIN-SHCORE-SCALING-L1-1-1  
* API-MS-WIN-POWER-BASE-L1-1-0  
* API-MS-WIN-CORE-WINRT-STRING-L1-1-0  
* API-MS-WIN-CORE-WINRT-L1-1-0  
* API-MS-WIN-CORE-WINRT-ERROR-L1-1-0
